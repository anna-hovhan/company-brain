# Company Brain note schemas

Frontmatter, naming, and folder for every Company Brain note type. Extends `references/ai-first-rules.md` (which still governs: preamble, universal fields, recency markers, wikilinks, confidence, anti-fabrication). Where a type exists in both files, the fields here are added on top of the AI-first schema.

The `brain` CLI parses these fields (`brain refresh`, `brain check`), so spelling matters: lowercase keys, values from the enumerations below, links as quoted `"[[wikilinks]]"`.

## Universal fields (every note)

```yaml
date: YYYY-MM-DD          # creation date, YYYY-MM-DD
updated: YYYY-MM-DD       # last meaningful edit (optional)
type: <type>              # from the tables below
tags: [<type>, ...]       # always include the type
ai-first: true
layer: company            # company | team | personal  (must match the folder)
team: "[[Platform]]"      # required when layer is team
owner: "[[Jane Doe]]"     # accountable person, where meaningful
```

Exempt from the universal fields: kanban boards (`kanban-plugin: board` frontmatter only), `Home.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `README.md`, `index.md`, `log.md`, everything in `Templates/`, `Sources/`, `Exports/`, `.company-brain/`.

## Periods and names

- Year: `YYYY`. Quarter: `YYYY-Qn` (fiscal quarters follow `company.fiscal_year_start` in `brain.yaml`; month 1 means calendar quarters). ISO week: `YYYY-Www`.
- `brain period` prints the current year, quarter, week, and the file names a daily, weekly, or team update should use today. Use it instead of computing dates by hand.

## Folder and filename by type

`<L>` is the layer root: `Company`, `Teams/<Team>`, or `Personal`.

| Type | Folder | Filename pattern |
|---|---|---|
| `me` | `Personal/` | `Me.md` |
| `person` | `Company/Org/People/` | `<Full Name>.md` |
| `team` | `Teams/<Team>/` | `<Team>.md` |
| `mission` / `vision` / `values` | `Company/` | `Mission.md`, `Vision.md`, `Values.md` |
| `strategy` | `<L>/Strategy/` | `Strategy - <horizon or name>.md` |
| `vpc` | `<L>/Strategy/` | `VPC - <Segment>.md` |
| `bmc` | `<L>/Strategy/` | `BMC - <Business or product>.md` |
| `objective` (annual) | `<L>/OKRs/` | `<YYYY> - <Owner> - O<n> - <Title>.md` |
| `objective` (quarterly) | `<L>/OKRs/` | `<YYYY-Qn> - <Owner> - O<n> - <Title>.md` |
| `objective` (personal goal) | `Personal/Goals/` | `<YYYY-Qn> - <First name> - G<n> - <Title>.md` |
| `plan` | `<L>/Planning/` | `Annual Plan <YYYY>.md`, `Quarterly Plan <YYYY-Qn>.md` (team: prefix `<Team> - `) |
| `outcome` | `<L>/Discovery/` | `OUT - <Title>.md` |
| `opportunity` | `<L>/Discovery/` | `OPP - <Title>.md` |
| `solution` | `<L>/Discovery/` | `SOL - <Title>.md` |
| `experiment` | `<L>/Discovery/` | `EXP - <Title>.md` |
| `project` | `<L>/Projects/` | `<Project name>.md` |
| `meeting` | `<L>/Meetings/` | `<YYYY-MM-DD> - <Meeting title>.md` |
| `one-on-one` | `Personal/1-1s/` | `1-1 - <Person>.md` (one running note per person) |
| `decision` | `<L>/Decisions/` | `DEC-<YYYY-MM-DD> - <Title>.md` |
| `daily` | `Personal/Daily/` | `<YYYY-MM-DD>.md` |
| `weekly` | `Personal/Weekly/` | `<YYYY>-W<WW>.md` |
| `team-update` | `Teams/<Team>/Weekly/` | `<YYYY>-W<WW> - <Team> - <Person>.md` |
| `team-weekly` | `Teams/<Team>/Weekly/` | `<YYYY>-W<WW> - <Team> - Team Weekly.md` |
| `knowledge` | `<L>/Knowledge/` (personal: `Personal/Notes/`) | `<Title>.md` |
| `hub` | any | `<Scope> <Area>.md`: `Company OKRs.md`, `Platform OKRs.md`, `Company Discovery.md` (scope is Company or the team name) |
| board | `<L>/` | `<Team> Board.md`, `My Board.md`, `Company/Roadmap/Company Roadmap.md`, `Teams/<Team>/<Team> Roadmap.md` |

Filenames are globally unique on purpose: Obsidian resolves `[[links]]` by filename, so two notes called `Weekly.md` in different layers would be ambiguous. The owner or team in the name is what keeps them apart.

## Type schemas

### `me`
```yaml
type: me
person: "[[Jane Doe]]"
teams: ["[[Platform]]"]
role: "TBD"
manager: "[[TBD]]"
timezone: UTC
email: "TBD"              # optional; work address only
```

### `person` (shared profile, company layer)
```yaml
type: person
role: "Product Manager"
team: "[[Platform]]"
manager: "[[Sam Lee]]"     # drives the org chart
location: "TBD"
start_date: TBD
timeline:                  # bi-temporal, append-only (see ai-first-rules.md)
  - fact: "Product Manager, Platform"
    from: YYYY-MM-DD
    until: present
    learned: YYYY-MM-DD
```
A shared profile holds only facts the person would be comfortable seeing on the company intranet. Impressions, feedback, and 1:1 content belong in `Personal/1-1s/`.

### `team`
```yaml
type: team
lead: "[[Sam Lee]]"
parent: "[[Engineering]]"  # optional: department or parent team
mission: "One sentence"
slack: "#team-platform"     # optional
rituals: ["weekly sync Tue", "retro biweekly"]
```

### `mission`, `vision`, `values`
```yaml
type: mission              # or vision, values
status: draft              # draft | approved
approved_by: "[[TBD]]"
review_by: YYYY-MM-DD
```

### `strategy`
```yaml
type: strategy
framework: kernel          # kernel | playing-to-win | both
horizon: "YYYY-YYYY"
status: draft              # draft | approved | superseded
supersedes: "[[...]]"      # optional
```

### `vpc` (Value Proposition Canvas)
```yaml
type: vpc
segment: "Mid-market PS teams"
status: hypothesis         # hypothesis | partially-validated | validated | retired
fit: problem-solution      # none | problem-solution | product-market | business-model
evidence: ["[[YYYY-MM-DD - Customer interview Acme]]"]
strategy: "[[Strategy - YYYY-YYYY]]"
```
Body sections (fixed names, parsed by `brain check`): `## Customer jobs`, `## Pains`, `## Gains`, `## Products and services`, `## Pain relievers`, `## Gain creators`, `## Fit`, `## Assumptions to test`.

### `bmc` (Business Model Canvas)
```yaml
type: bmc
status: draft
```
Body sections: the nine blocks (`## Customer segments`, `## Value propositions`, `## Channels`, `## Customer relationships`, `## Revenue streams`, `## Key resources`, `## Key activities`, `## Key partnerships`, `## Cost structure`).

### `objective` (OKR objective, holding its key results)
```yaml
type: objective
level: company             # company | team | personal
period: YYYY-Qn            # YYYY for annual objectives
owner: "[[Jane Doe]]"
parent: "[[YYYY - Company - O1 - Become the default AI workspace#^kr2]]"   # what this ladders up to
status: on-track           # on-track | at-risk | off-track | done | dropped
last_checkin: YYYY-MM-DD
```
Key results are list items in the `## Key results` section, each with inline Dataview fields and a block id so other notes can link to one KR:

```markdown
- **KR1** Weekly active teams from 1200 to 2000 [baseline:: 1200] [target:: 2000] [current:: 1450] [unit:: teams] [confidence:: medium] [owner:: [[Jane Doe]]] ^kr1
- **KR2** Ship the self-serve onboarding flow [progress:: 0.4] [confidence:: high] [owner:: [[Sam Lee]]] ^kr2
```
- Progress is `progress::` when given (0.0 to 1.0), else computed from `baseline`, `target`, `current`, clamped to 0..1. Objective score is the mean of its KR progress.
- Link to a KR as `[[<objective note>#^kr1]]`. `parent:` may point at an objective or at one KR; prefer the KR.
- Check-ins append a row to `## Check-ins`: `| YYYY-MM-DD | KR1 | 1450 | medium | note |`.
- Scoring convention: 0.7 is a good outcome for an ambitious KR; 1.0 every time means the target was not ambitious.

### `plan`

type: prioritization       # generated
type: org-chart            # generated
```

## Auto blocks

Generated content lives between markers that `brain refresh` rewrites; everything outside them is preserved:

```markdown
<!-- brain:auto:start okr-tree -->
...generated...
<!-- brain:auto:end okr-tree -->
```
Never hand-edit inside the markers; edit the source notes and run `brain refresh`.
