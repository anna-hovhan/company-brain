## For future agent
This note is a strategy choice cascade in the Playing to Win form (Lafley and Martin) for <% horizon %> at the <% layer %> layer: winning aspiration, where to play, how to win, capabilities, management systems.

## 1. Winning aspiration
What does winning look like, for whom? Connects to [[Vision]].
- TBD

## 2. Where to play
Segments, geographies, channels, offers, and value-chain stages we choose, and the ones we choose not to play in.
| Dimension | We play | We do not play |
|---|---|---|
| Customer segments | TBD | TBD |
| Geography | TBD | TBD |
| Offers | TBD | TBD |
| Channels | TBD | TBD |

## 3. How to win
Cost leadership or differentiation, and the specific advantage in each chosen place. Link the value proposition canvas per segment.
- TBD

## 4. Capabilities that must be in place
- TBD

## 5. Management systems
How we will measure and run it: OKRs ([[Company OKRs]]), cadence ([[Company Planning]]), the roadmap ([[Company Roadmap]]).
- TBD

## Coherence check
Each choice should reinforce the ones above and below it. Contradictions found: TBD

Method: [[Playing to Win]].
