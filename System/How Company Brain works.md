# How Company Brain works

## For future agent
This note is the plain-language overview of Company Brain: what it is, the three ways to use it (Obsidian, Claude, a Claude Project), the layer model, the operating rhythm, and how the pieces connect into one graph. Start here before reading the specs in `.company-brain/references/`.

## In one paragraph
Company Brain is a folder of markdown notes that holds a company's mission, strategy, goals, discovery, roadmap, organization, projects, meetings, and weekly work, all linked so it reads like one network. People browse and edit it in [[Obsidian]]; Claude reads and writes it through the Company Brain plugin (skills, hooks, an MCP server, and the `brain` CLI); colleagues who only use claude.ai can get a read-only snapshot as a Claude Project. It is built on the single-person [[obsidian-second-brain]] engine and adds team and company layers.

## Three ways in
| Surface | Who | Can write | How |
|---|---|---|---|
| Obsidian | everyone | yes | open this folder as a vault; Dataview hubs, Kanban boards, Templater templates, graph colour-coded by layer |
| Claude (Claude Code CLI, desktop app, Cowork) | anyone with the plugin | yes | `/company-brain:<skill>`, or just ask ("write my weekly note") |
| Claude Project on claude.ai | colleagues without Claude Code | no | upload the pack from `/company-brain:export` |

## Layers
- **Company** (`Company/`): shared with everyone.
- **Team** (`Teams/<Team>/`): shared with everyone, owned by the team.
- **Personal** (`Personal/`): yours only, never leaves your machine.
Links point up the stack, never down. Details: [[Layers and privacy]].

## The operating rhythm
| When | You run | What happens |
|---|---|---|
| Daily | `/company-brain:daily` | today's note: calendar, top three focus items linked to key results |
| Weekly | `/company-brain:weekly` | pulls the week from calendar, Slack, email, Jira, Drive, meeting notes; action items to your board; KR check-ins; drafts and publishes your team update |
| Weekly (lead) | `/company-brain:team-weekly` | team roll-up from everyone's updates, KR trends, risks, decisions needed |
| Per meeting | `/company-brain:meeting` | meeting note in the right layer, decisions and actions routed |
| Quarterly | `/company-brain:plan quarterly` | score, set OKRs top-down, discovery focus, prioritize, roadmap |
| Annually | `/company-brain:plan annual` | mission, vision, strategy review, annual objectives |
| Any time | `/company-brain:health` | leaks, broken links, unaligned OKRs, rebuild generated views |

## How it becomes a brain
Every note links to what it serves. A weekly note links key results; a key result belongs to an objective whose `parent:` is a company key result; that ladders to an annual objective, which serves the [[Mission]]. Discovery nodes link outcome, opportunity, solution, experiment. Projects link solutions and key results. People link teams and managers. Hubs ([[Company]], [[Company OKRs]], [[Company Discovery]], [[Organization]]) gather each area with live Dataview tables. `brain refresh` regenerates the views that tie it together: OKR trees, discovery trees and canvases, the prioritization matrix, the org chart, and `index.md`.

## Where things live
- Notes: `Company/`, `Teams/`, `Personal/`.
- External files: `Sources/` (symlinks to Desktop and Google Drive folders, read-only).
- Method: [[Frameworks]]. Templates: `Templates/`. Skills catalog: [[Skills]]. Automations: [[Automations]]. Setup: [[Setup]].
- Engine (hidden in Obsidian): `.company-brain/` holds the plugin, CLI, hooks, MCP server, and specs.
