## For future agent
This note is a <% layer %>-level objective for <% period %>, owned by <% owner %>. It holds the key results with live progress fields, the check-in history, and what it ladders up to (<% parent %>). Progress values change weekly: trust the latest Check-ins row, not prose.

## Objective
TBD. Qualitative, inspiring, time-bound. Answers: what do we want to achieve this period, and why does it matter now?

## Why now
TBD. Link the strategy or diagnosis this serves, for example [[Company Strategy]].

## Key results
<!-- One line per KR. Keep the block id (^kr1) so other notes can link to one KR as note-name#^kr1.
Numeric KR: baseline, target, current. Milestone KR: progress 0.0-1.0. Confidence: high, medium, low. -->
- **KR1** TBD [baseline:: 0] [target:: 0] [current:: 0] [unit:: TBD] [confidence:: medium] [owner:: <% owner %>] ^kr1
- **KR2** TBD [progress:: 0] [confidence:: medium] [owner:: <% owner %>] ^kr2
- **KR3** TBD [baseline:: 0] [target:: 0] [current:: 0] [unit:: TBD] [confidence:: medium] [owner:: <% owner %>] ^kr3

## Supporting objectives
Objectives in other layers whose `parent:` points here:
```dataview
LIST FROM "Company" OR "Teams" OR "Personal/Goals"
WHERE type = "objective" AND contains(string(parent), this.file.name)
```

## Supporting projects and outcomes
```dataview
TABLE type, status, owner
FROM "Company" OR "Teams"
WHERE (type = "project" AND contains(string(okrs), this.file.name)) OR (type = "outcome" AND contains(string(kr), this.file.name))
```

## Check-ins
| Date | KR | Value | Confidence | Note |
|---|---|---|---|---|

## Retrospective
Filled at the end of the period: final score per KR, what worked, what we learned, what carries over.
