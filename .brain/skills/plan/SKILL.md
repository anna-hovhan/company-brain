# Plan

Orchestrates other skills; the plan note (`type: plan`) records the choices. Company plans in `Company/Planning/`, team plans in `Teams/<Team>/Planning/`.

## Before you start
1. **Find the brain.** The session context has a **Company Brain** line with the brain path and the engine path. If it is missing, run `python3 "${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/../../scripts/brain.py" root`. No brain found: stop and tell the user to open Claude in the brain folder or set the plugin's vault path.
2. **`brain`** below means `python3 "<engine>/scripts/brain.py" --root "<brain>"` (or `./brain` from the brain root).
3. **Read the rules** in `<brain>/CLAUDE.md` unless they are already loaded, and `Personal/Me.md` for who "me" and "my team" are. No `Me.md`: run the `setup` skill first.
4. **Write only with file tools or the `brain` CLI.** Never use the obsidian-second-brain MCP tools here; they point at a different vault.

## Quarterly (default)
1. **Score last quarter**: run `okr` score for every objective in the previous quarter at this layer. Fill the plan's `## 1. Last quarter` table with scores and one lesson each.
2. **Context**: `context` level 2. Note what changed (new knowledge notes, decisions, team changes) since the last plan.
3. **Draft objectives**: company plan: three to five quarterly company objectives, each laddering up to an annual company KR. Team plan: two to four team objectives, each laddering up to a company KR. Create each with `okr` create once the user agrees.
4. **Discovery focus**: for each KR that needs discovery, start or update an opportunity solution tree with `ost` (outcome node linked to the KR).
5. **Prioritize**: run `prioritize` for the layer; record which quick wins go to Now and how big bets are sliced.
6. **Roadmap**: run `roadmap` to move cards between Now, Next, and Later.
7. **Cadence**: set check-in rhythm, mid-quarter review date, scoring date. Offer to add them to the calendar (ask first; creating events is outward-facing).
8. **Write**: `brain new quarterly-plan --layer <layer> [--team T] --set period=<YYYY-Qn>` and fill each section with links. Status `draft` until the user says it is committed.

## Annual
1. Score the year (annual objectives) and summarize the four quarterly retrospectives.
2. Revisit `[[Mission]]`, `[[Vision]]`, `[[Values]]` and the current strategy with `strategy` (kernel diagnosis first: has the challenge changed?). Refresh value proposition canvases with `vpc` for segments that matter next year.
3. Set three to five annual company objectives with `okr` create (period `YYYY`, no parent).
4. Big bets and stop-doing list, organization changes (`org`), quarter-by-quarter shape.
5. `brain new annual-plan --set period=<YYYY>` and fill.

## Rules
- Plans are proposals until committed: present drafts in chat, write the plan note with `status: draft`, switch to `committed` only on the user's word.
- Never create OKRs for another team without its lead; draft them as proposals in the team plan instead.
- Finish with `brain refresh` and a one-screen summary: objectives, discovery focus, Now column, dates.

## Always
- Layers: Company/ and Teams/ are shared; Personal/ is local only. Never link from a shared note to a Personal note, and never copy content under `## Private` out of Personal/ (`references/layers.md`).
- AI-first notes: frontmatter with `date`, `type`, `tags`, `ai-first: true`, `layer`; a `## For future agent` preamble; `[[wikilinks]]` for every person, team, objective, and project (`references/ai-first-rules.md`, `references/schemas.md`).
- Search before create (`brain new` refuses duplicates and prints the existing path). Never invent facts, numbers, dates, or people: write `TBD` and ask.
- Finish with `brain refresh` when OKRs, discovery, scores, or people changed, otherwise `brain index`. With `sharing: git`, list the shared files changed and suggest a commit; never push or open a pull request yourself.
