name: promote
description: Share a personal note with the team or company - builds a sanitized copy (no Private sections, no links to personal notes, no personal-only fields), shows the diff, writes it in the target layer, and links back up from the personal note; also promotes team notes to the company layer. Use for "share this with the team", "publish this", "promote to company", "make this a team note".

# Promote

The only path from Personal/ to a shared layer. Spec: `references/layers.md` (Promotion). Nothing is promoted without the user's explicit yes.

## Before you start
1. **Find the brain.** The session context has a **Company Brain** line with the brain path and the engine path. If it is missing, run `python3 "${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/../../scripts/brain.py" root`. No brain found: stop and tell the user to open Claude in the brain folder or set the plugin's vault path.
2. **`brain`** below means `python3 "<engine>/scripts/brain.py" --root "<brain>"` (or `./brain` from the brain root).
3. **Read the rules** in `<brain>/CLAUDE.md` unless they are already loaded, and `Personal/Me.md` for who "me" and "my team" are. No `Me.md`: run the `setup` skill first.
4. **Write only with file tools or the `brain` CLI.** Never use the obsidian-second-brain MCP tools here; they point at a different vault.

## Steps
1. **Source and target**: the note to share (personal or team) and the target layer and team. Ask if not stated.
2. **Type and place**: keep the type when it exists in the target layer (decision, meeting, project, knowledge); a personal weekly becomes a `team-update`; a personal goal becomes a draft team objective proposal (handled by `okr` create, with the team lead).
3. **Build the shared version** with `brain promote "<note path>" --to team|company [--team "<Team>"] [--kind <kind>] [--name "<stem>"]`. Without `--yes` it is a dry run that writes nothing and prints what was removed plus the diff. It:
   - drops every `## Private` section;
   - rewrites every link to a Personal/ note as plain text (keeps the words, drops the brackets);
   - removes personal-only fields (`energy`, `mood`, `promoted_to`, the `private` tag), sets `layer:` and `team:`, keeps `date`;
   - turns a personal weekly into a team update built from its `## Team update` draft only;
   - refuses `me`, daily, 1:1, and personal-goal notes, and names that already exist in a shared layer.
4. **Review the dry run yourself** for anything the user would consider private that is not under `## Private` (candid remarks, names, quotes from private messages). Propose edits to the personal note, or `--name`, and re-run the dry run.
5. **Show the user the diff** and wait for an explicit yes.
6. **Write**: re-run the same command with `--yes`. It writes the shared note, adds `promoted_to: "[[<shared note>]]"` to the source (an upward link, allowed), and runs the layer check on the result; fix anything it reports.
7. **Preamble**: rewrite the shared note's `## For future agent` preamble for the shared audience (team updates already get one from their template). Do not record the personal note's path anywhere in the shared note.
8. With `sharing: git`, suggest a commit (team layer) or a pull request (company layer).

## Always
- Layers: Company/ and Teams/ are shared; Personal/ is local only. Never link from a shared note to a Personal note, and never copy content under `## Private` out of Personal/ (`references/layers.md`).
- AI-first notes: frontmatter with `date`, `type`, `tags`, `ai-first: true`, `layer`; a `## For future agent` preamble; `[[wikilinks]]` for every person, team, objective, and project (`references/ai-first-rules.md`, `references/schemas.md`).
- Search before create (`brain new` refuses duplicates and prints the existing path). Never invent facts, numbers, dates, or people: write `TBD` and ask.
- Finish with `brain refresh` when OKRs, discovery, scores, or people changed, otherwise `brain index`. With `sharing: git`, list the shared files changed and suggest a commit; never push or open a pull request yourself.
